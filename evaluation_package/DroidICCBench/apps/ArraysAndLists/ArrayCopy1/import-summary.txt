ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* build.xml
* conf/
* conf/DroidBench.xml
* expected-info-flows.txt
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/java/
* res/drawable-hdpi/ic_launcher.png => app/src/main/resources/drawable-hdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/drawable-mdpi/ic_launcher.png => app/src/main/resources/drawable-mdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png => app/src/main/resources/drawable-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/layout/activity_main.xml => app/src/main/resources/layout/activity_main.xml
* res/menu/main.xml => app/src/main/resources/menu/main.xml
* res/values-sw600dp/dimens.xml => app/src/main/resources/values-sw600dp/dimens.xml
* res/values-sw720dp-land/dimens.xml => app/src/main/resources/values-sw720dp-land/dimens.xml
* res/values-v11/styles.xml => app/src/main/resources/values-v11/styles.xml
* res/values-v14/styles.xml => app/src/main/resources/values-v14/styles.xml
* res/values/dimens.xml => app/src/main/resources/values/dimens.xml
* res/values/strings.xml => app/src/main/resources/values/strings.xml
* res/values/styles.xml => app/src/main/resources/values/styles.xml
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
